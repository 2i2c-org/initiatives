# Initiatives

Experimental repository to contain 2i2c org-wide public initiatives
that are available for communities to fund together

## Why?

Our [public roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap/index) is excellent, and needs a single source
of *structured* truth. When this repository was started, it's source of truth is initiatives
in:

1. Issues in the [2i2c-org/infrastructure](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure) repo
2. Specific words used in the title of the issues
3. Specific *labels* applied to the issue
4. Specific Project Fields set in the [Products & Services Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/57)

In addition, the issues in the infrastructure repository have a few problems:

1. They were originally written with an *internal* facing audience, to serve as parent
   issues for subtasks. They are not particularly friendly to external audiences, and are
   thus not easy to use as *sales assets*.
2. Some of them are stale or outdated, as our thinking has evolved over time.

This repository, along with [a corresponding new project board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/67/views/1)
is an experiment to try the following:

1. Can we use GitHub project fields as a *dedicated* way to measure structured pieces of
   information (such as levels of detail, current funding situation, internal / external labels,
   etc) that are useful to publicly surface?
2. Can we use GitHub actions to automatically (and deterministically) *lint*
   these issues, to make sure that they *actually* follow the standard structure we
   are trying to follow with our levels of detail?
3. (not as important) can the code that maintains [our public roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap/index) be simpler
   and more clearly maintainable if it pulls from a structured github project?
4. Can we rewrite some of the existing initiatives to have a more external facing focus?

## Timeline

There is always risk of too much fiddling with a system as a way to procrastinate actually using
the system, so this should not take more than one week. Let's learn what we can at the one week mark
and move on.

## Yuvi's current process

1. We are participating in VEDA PI planning. Can we use that as an experiment to validate our overall structure?
2. Let's treat all the projects we are undertaking (user facing & non-user facing) for this VEDA quarter *that
   serve all our communities* as initiatives here. See if that is useful framing for *VEDA*, as they want to
   demonstrate the value they provide to the broader world.
